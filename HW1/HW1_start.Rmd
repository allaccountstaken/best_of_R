```

## Country level analysis

1.    We are interested in the data at the most recent date, June 3 2021. Create a data
frame called `latest` that:
  *   has only rows pertaining to data from June 3 2021:

```{r}
latest <- subset(Covid, date == "2021-06-03")
dim(latest)
head(latest)
```
  * removes rows pertaining to counties that are "Unknown"

  * removes the column `date` and `fips`
