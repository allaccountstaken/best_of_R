## Load the data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
students <- read.csv("new_students.csv", header = TRUE)
head(students)
```
1. Produce a frequency table of the number of students in each level of `GPA.cat`.
```{r}
students$GPA.cat<-factor(students$GPA.cat, levels=c("low", "moderate", "high"))
table(students$GPA.cat)
```

2. Produce a bar chart that summarizes the number of students in each level of GPA.cat.
```{r}
ggplot(students, aes(x=GPA.cat))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(x="GPA category", y="Number of students",
        title="Breaksown of students by GPA category")
```



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
